                <p class="lead">With years of reckless use of global energy resources has made the earth deplete of its natural resources, with our current automobiles looking at a perilous future with nothing to thrive on. Yes, we have all heard that before but are we really doing something substantial to cope up with such a grave loss? </p>

                <p class="lead">Team Infieon Superlileage has taken up this challenge to design vehicles that are extremely fuel efficient. By extracting the maximum possible efficiency from a liter of gasoline, we strive to ensure a sustainable future. Team Infieon as part of its social responsibility aims at connecting with a large population in order to educate them about green and clean driving. Infieon primarily aims at spreading the message of fuel efficiency far and wide through campaigns on fuel consumption, green driving and the depletion of current resources, through educative and informative seminars, collaboration with NGOs that share the same vision and propagation through every possible form of media.</p>
